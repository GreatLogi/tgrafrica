                <p style="text-align: justify">TGR Africa is guided by the great return philosophy. We believe  the African diaspora can play a significant role in the development of Africa. We believe the diaspora possess the skills, expertise and financial capital needed to support African development. Our long term vision is for the African Diaspora to be mobilised into a collective economic unit which can play a significant role in the affairs of African Nations.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">African development from our perspective is all about creating an Africa which is economically self sufficient, an Africa which has its own unique identity that is not dictated by the West and an Africa which is able to be respected on the international scene. We want to prevent Africa from ever having to go through the experience of colonialism and imperialism again and we believe this can only be achieved through economic power.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> We also want to make Africa a desirable place to live so that domestic Africans donâ€™t feel the need to migrate to foreign lands in search of economic opportunities and for Africa to become such a desirable place to live that even those in the Diaspora would want to return.
